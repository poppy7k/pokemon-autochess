Hello @everyone,

I am very happy to present Pokemon Auto Chess version 1.5: the Map Update.

**New map system**

I saw very little use of the different maps available in the profile section.
The five old map types are removed.
Puddles are removed.
Theres now 130 different new maps. Those maps are based on Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Red/Blue Air/Darkness dungeons. You'll see the name of every dungeon on the top left.
Every map will be different from one game to an other as it will be generated when the game start.
Each map will have its own music.
