## Show me your moves

New fighting animations for almost all Pokemon, and a brand new HUD redesign !

## Human after all

Bots are no longer taken into account for ELO gain/loss calculations. Lobbys don't need 8 players any more to be elligible for ELO, but need at least 2 human players.

## Getting sweaty

- More Aquatic mons: Poliwag, Tentacool, Lotad, Froakie, Phione now have the Aquatic synergy
- Many Psychic abilities have been reworked
- New abilities for all mons that only had a passive effect
